### Patch Changes

- 363768a: "Plan your modules" is now a signal chain of cards. On air shows what
  the world runs; Next is the setup you build, in the order a call flows:
  effects, the service, the cameras and the Dock's theme. Open a stage to
  see its modules as tiles, each with what it is for and one action; a
  world with no service starts from three common builds. Load in, Go live
  and Soundcheck walk you to Foundry's Setup screen and back, and
  Soundcheck opens each module's settings where they live.

  For module authors: the Voice & Video Settings window can open on a tab
  (`SettingsHost.tab`, a `SettingsWindowTab`; while it is open,
  `SettingsHost.onTabRequest` tells the surface, which keeps what is
  drafted), its code loads when it first opens, and each module's manifest
  can give its card an icon and a few facts (`flags["modular-av"].icon`
  and `.facts`).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- fda84f1: For module authors: `api.preview.camera(element, { device, effect })` and
  `api.preview.microphone(element, { device, listener })` preview a device
  outside the call, and stop when asked or when the element goes. A
  contributed control can name the `effect` it belongs to, and is shown
  under that effect when it is chosen; a settings section can name its
  `tab` (`"call"`, `"voice"`, `"video"` or `"appearance"`).

  Camera background's strength and picture now show under Blur and Replace
  themselves, instead of in a section of their own.

  The testing package's fake Foundry holds the world's A/V settings as
  `core.rtcWorldSettings`, as Foundry does, and fakes the previews.
