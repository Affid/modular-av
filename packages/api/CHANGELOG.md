# @modular-av/api

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- be36f7d: Plan your modules: GMs open an assembly board from the core's module
  settings or the Voice & Video Settings window. Every Modular A/V module
  is a piece: put the service, the cameras and the effects you want on the
  board; it gives the fewest links to install on Foundry's Setup screen
  (copy them, save a file or whisper them to yourself), then turns modules
  on and off for the world, never leaving it without its running service.
  Updates and new modules come from the family's catalog on GitHub (a
  world setting turns asking GitHub off). With no service enabled, a GM is
  told which exist; the settings window says the effects are modules of
  their own. Installing a module now offers what it needs: every family
  relationship carries its manifest URL, and the core recommends only the
  dock. `SettingsHost.openModules()` is new in the API.

## 0.3.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e37fee: `ParticipantState.blockedAudio` and `blockedVideo`: a GM took away a kind
  the world's mode allows. UIs no longer work it out from `worldMode` and
  `canBroadcast`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- A service can ask for a fresh token while connected
  (`ServiceConnection.updateToken`, answered through the GM relay), so a
  long call over Jitsi stays up after its first token runs out.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First release of the shared API types, UI helpers and test tooling
  (fake Foundry, mock service, service, UI and effects contracts).
